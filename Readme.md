#Pure functional programming has a set of rules to follow:
1. No state
2. Pure Functions
    1. Should not depend on global variables outside the function scope
3. No Side Effects
    1. Logic should impact within function scope only, should not have effect or impact outside 
4. Consider as Higher Order Functions if one of the below matched
    1. The function takes one or more functions as parameters.
    2. The function returns another function as result. (e.g. Combinator pattern)
